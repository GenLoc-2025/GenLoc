134541,"The bug report indicates a mismatch between the line number associated with an 'advice' warning and the actual line number in the code. Specifically, it notes that when an advice is changed (e.g., when a line is inserted before it), the displayed line number for the warning does not update correctly until a full rebuild is performed. This appears to be related to warnings generated by the AspectJ weaver, particularly during advising scenarios, which indicates there is a potential issue in the components handling advice declarations or managing line numbers in the code after modifications.

The keywords of interest extracted from the report include:  advice, line number, warning, mismatch, update, full rebuild. The reported functionality involves ensuring the correct linkage of advice warnings with their positions in the source code after modifications. Given that this is a regression issue that did not exist in AJ 1.5.0, it's likely related to code changes in advice handling or warning signal processing.

- **Error Message**: `NullPointerException`

- The error traceback involves methods related to AspectJ's internal structure: `equals` methods and potentially their interactions with null arguments.

- **AspectJ weaving mechanism**: This suggests that elements like pointcuts or aspects are involved, hinting at potential correlations with `BcelTypeMunger` and others based on additional tracing provided in the report description, which might be helpful in deciphering the root cause.
