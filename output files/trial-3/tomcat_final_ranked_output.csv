51509,"The bug report indicates that the `LruCache` used in the `CsrfPreventionFilter` is not thread-safe due to underlying use of `LinkedHashMap`, which is indeed not synchronized for concurrent access. The issue primarily revolves around the lack of proper synchronization when `LruCache` is accessed by multiple threads, especially during modifications. The bug report directly mentions the constructor of `LruCache`, which initiates a `LinkedHashMap`, leading to concerns around concurrent access. Key methods mentioned include `add(T key)` and `contains(T key)` which directly manipulates the shared cache, potentially causing race conditions when accessed by multiple threads without external synchronization.

The core issue arises from the interceptor properties not being set before invoking the pool close callback, leading to failures when closing or deregistering the MBean. In particular, the problematic portion of the code is during the interceptor's `poolClosed` invocation where it seems to require properties that might not have been initialized properly during the connection pool's close procedure. 

**Keywords/Components Identified**:  
1. `SlowQueryReportJmx` - indicates the specific MBean involved.  
2. `NPE` - suggests the primary error type encountered.  
3. `poolClosed` - points to the callback which contains the bug.
