- Tomcat memory leak detection
- Reflection based code
- IBM JDK
- ThreadLocal memory leaks
- Warning messages
- WebappClassLoader.loadedByThisOrChild
- expungeStaleEntries method

### Functional Hints and Issues Based on the Report
1. The detection code interacts closely with various Java class loaders, particularly in the context of handling memory leaks.
2. There are reflective operations in the code that must function with different JDKs (Sun vs IBM), indicating a need for compatibility checks.
3. The WebappClassLoader seems to have a critical issue with traversing the classloader hierarchy.
4. New tests are introduced to better handle thread-local leaks, pointing towards methods for cleanup and initialization within classloaders.
5. References to specific method signatures (e.g., loadedByThisOrChild(Object)) are noted, emphasizing their role in memory leak prevention.

### Affected Components
- Classloaders (especially `WebappClassLoader`)
- Memory Leak Prevention Listeners (e.g., `JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener`, `ThreadLocalLeakPreventionListener`)
- Various Test Cases related to memory leak detection.

53001,"### Bug Analysis
The bug report focuses on the behavior of `ResourceBundleELResolver` from the `el-api` library and compares it to the standard `el-api` resolver. The reported issue involves how missing properties are handled: the Tomcat version does not set the resolved property to `true`, leading to a scenario where exceptions are thrown, causing application crashes on production sites.

### Keywords & Components Extracted
- **Keywords**: `ResourceBundleELResolver`, `el-api`, `missing properties`, `exception`, `production sites`, `faces-config.xml`, `getValue(...)`, `PropertyResolved`
- **Components**: EL (Expression Language) resolution mechanism, resource bundles, custom resolver implementation, and management via `faces-config.xml` in JSF (JavaServer Faces).

If it encounters an underflow (a situation where it expects more bytes than are present), leftover bytes remain in the buffer, which can lead to corrupted data on subsequent requests. Key points from the report include:

1. **Critical Classes and Methods**: The problem predominantly involves the `B2CConverter` class, specifically its `convert(ByteChunk bc, CharChunk cc)` method, along with the classes `ByteChunk` and `CharChunk` that interact with it. The `Request` class is also vital since it's indicated that `B2CConverter` is not recycled with `Request`. Furthermore, the `CoyoteAdapter` class is implicated due to its handling of URI conversions.

2. **Key Terms & Behaviors**: The bug focuses on keywords such as 'decode underflow', 'buffer', 'reused', 'extra bytes', and 'not recycled'. The described steps in handling the conversion hint at how the classes interact and how improper recycling leads to the issue.

3. **System Behavior**: There’s an assertion in the report that recycling the `B2CConverter` upon request completion would mitigate the problem, as would adjusting how bytes are read during conversions.
