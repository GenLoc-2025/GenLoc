51588,"### Bug Report Analysis:
The bug report focuses on modifying access modifiers in the `AccessLogValve` class to allow easier extension for subclasses by changing two `createAccessLogElement()` methods from private to protected. This change facilitates overriding these methods in subclasses. 

### Keywords Extracted:
- Change access modifiers
- AccessLogValve
- createLogElements()
- createAccessLogElement()

### Affected Components:
- `AccessLogValve`: The report mentions this class which contains potentially relevant methods for logging access and handling log elements.
- `ExtendedAccessLogValve`: This class extends the `AccessLogValve`, suggesting similar coding conventions that may require quick access modifications.

### Referenced Methods:
- `createLogElements()`: This method is identified in both classes and plays a central role in how access log elements are created.
- `createAccessLogElement()`: The existence of overloaded versions of this method indicates a design used in constructing different log elements based on the character pattern provided.

### Conclusion:  
Focusing on `AccessLogValve` and `ExtendedAccessLogValve` is critical as they directly relate to the user’s intention to modify access levels for logging functionality.

1. **Error Location**: The NPE is caused by the absence of a null-check for the `attachment` variable, which is assigned the result of `socket.getAttachment(false)`. If this method returns `null`, attempting to call `attachment.setCometNotify(false)` results in an NPE.
2. **Related Classes and Methods**: The bug also references the `cancelledKey` and `timeout` methods from the same class, hinting that the issue may be related to connection state management and timing out connections improperly.
3. **Tomcat and Nio Connectors**: The broader context involves the NIO connector and dropped connections, indicating that this problem might affect performance and reliability in web serving through Tomcat.

The issue stems from the incorrect handling of multi-byte characters, particularly those that may lead to character underflows.

The second issue raised is the recycling mechanism of `B2CConverter` instances within `Request`, where they should be recycled to prevent data leakage between requests.

55943,"The bug report addresses a need to change class loading behavior in Apache Tomcat. Specifically, it suggests that the system class loader should not be checked before the web application class loaders when deploying embedded servlet containers. The report mentions issues while adding Tomcat support to an SBT plugin, particularly around conflicts arising from Scala library versions between the system and web application classpaths. Keywords extracted include 'System classloader', 'webapp classloaders', 'Tomcat', 'SBT', 'isolated servlet containers', 'conflicting versions', and 'patch'.
